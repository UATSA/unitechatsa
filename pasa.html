                        <p>Hi and greetings in the name of Jesus,
As President, I am delighted to introduce you to the Papua Adventist Student Association 
(PASA). Our mission is to create a nurturing and spiritually enriching environment for all 
members, where everyone feels welcome and supported. This year, 2025, I am honoured to 
lead this association alongside Mackenna Wai and work hand in hand with all executives of 
this vibrant family to create an environment that reflects our shared values and beliefs.
<br>Our focus will be on fostering a nurturing and spiritually enriching atmosphere where everyone 
feels welcome and supported. Together, we will engage in activities and events that promote
academic excellence, community outreach, and spiritual growth."
<br>PASA includes individuals from Western, Gulf, Milne Bay, and Central provinces. However, 
this does not restrict anyone or any student who wishes to join the team. Our focus is to get 
as many individuals as possible to know Christ thoroughly and let God dwell in their hearts 
so that together we can be saved when Christ returns.</p>

As secretary, my role is to ensure meetings are effectively organized and minutes to be taken, to maintain records and to ensure smooth operation of the group by keeping track of key details and decisions made. <br>

                        <p>It is a blessing for me to serve as the 2025 PASA Choir Master. Singing creates a bond between the students and strengthens our relationship with God. Our pioneer Choir Master Jack Vagi had composed several songs which are based upon our life experiences and struggles, hence our composed songs are our prayers.<br>
                        I have always told my friends that PASA is a ship, Jesus is the Captain, and all of us students are the crew members. We shall sail through the storms of family problems, the waves of personally struggles will beat on us, and tempt us to follow the easier and exciting path of the world that will lead us astray. Nevertheless, we must always have faith that PASA is a ship and Jesus is the Captain. Thus, having Jesus as the captain and master of our life is a wonderful thing.<br>
                        If you wish to sing choir with us, please send an email to unitech.atsa.info@gmail.com and express your interest. We can't wait to have you join or support our choir to praise God.
                        <p style="font-family: Brush-script, cursive;"><br>Blessings,</p>

                        <h3>Fundraising</h3>
                       <p>Hi my name is Rizpah Puramo. I am the fundraising leader for Papua Adventist Student Association for the year 2025 here in Unitech. I would like to take this time to welcome you all in the blessed name of our loving lord Jesus Christ. With great pleasure, I am privilege to embrace this role as the fundraising leader.<br>
Basically, my role as the fundraising leader in Papua Adventist Student Association is to organize and carry out corporate fundraising activities that will help bring income into the student ministry group that the ministry will use to carry out its planned programs for this year, both in reach and outreach.<br>
It is with great anticipation, that these fundraising activities whilst carrying them out together will help us build Christian bonds within the ministry and leave a Christian influence in the campus and also to get to know each other more for the effectiveness of the ministry in PASA, Unitech and church as a whole. I also deeply believe that carrying these fundraising activities out as an Adventist student, God will greatly use this opportunity to touch many lives at a student level.<br>
I wholeheartedly believe that with the bond of unity in faith that Jesus Christ has blessed PASA with through the presence of the Holy Spirit, we will work as one to archive our set goals and most importantly to lead other to the feet of Jesus Christ.
I am with great zeal for the ministry of the gospel of Jesus Christ looking forward to working with you all come this 2025.
                       </p>
