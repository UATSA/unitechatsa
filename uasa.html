                        <h3>Spiritual Leader</h3>
                        <p>Greetings to you all in the name of our soon-coming Savior, Jesus Christ. Welcome to the 
Spiritual Department of the Unitech Adventist Tertiary Students Association (ATSA). The 
Spiritual Department of Unitech ATSA is dedicated to nurturing the spiritual growth and 
well-being of Adventist students at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology. Our 
mission is to encourage and support students in maintaining a strong and vibrant relationship 
with God as they navigate their academic journey.<br>
The Spiritual Department seeks to provide spiritual nourishment through daily Bible study, 
prayer, and other spiritual activities that foster a deeper connection with our Creator. We are 
committed to helping students grow in their faith, stay grounded in God’s Word, and actively 
engage in His mission both on and off campus.</p>
<p>Key activities of the Unitech ATSA Spiritual Department include:</p>
<p><b>Bible Study:</b> The Spiritual Department encourages Adventist students to engage deeply with 
the Scriptures, guiding them to not only study the Word but also share it with others. We 
believe that studying the Bible strengthens students’ spiritual integrity and equips them to 
live out their faith in their academic and personal lives.<br>
<b>Prayer:</b> Every Sunday morning, the Spiritual Department organizes group prayer sessions, 
where Adventist students come together to communicate with God through prayer and 
supplication. These sessions help students build a consistent prayer life, strengthen their bond 
with God, and foster a spirit of unity among like-minded believers.<br>
<b>Branch Sabbath School Program:</b> Each Sabbath morning, the Spiritual Department 
coordinates Branch Sabbath School sessions where Adventist students share God’s love and 
experiences with their peers in dormitories. Through Bible stories, songs, and fellowship, 
students are encouraged to stand firm in their faith while also helping others experience the 
love of Christ. This program serves as a refreshing spiritual revival after a week of academic 
challenges.<br>
<b>Outreach Programs:</b> The Spiritual Department also facilitates outreach initiatives, 
encouraging students to extend God’s love to the surrounding community. Through these 
programs, students are given opportunities to share their faith, assist those in need, and 
actively participate in spreading the Gospel message.<br>
In addition to these activities, the Spiritual Department plays a vital role in organizing and 
supporting other spiritual programs within the church and school community. Our goal is to 
provide a nurturing spiritual environment where students can grow in their faith, share the 
love of God, and be a light in the world around them.<br>
We are here to help each other support our spiritual journey, helping ourselves to stay 
connected to God and remain steadfast in our commitment to His mission, even as we pursue 
our studies. May we experience spiritual growth, peace, and joy as we walk with God 
throughout our academic journey.</p>

As the choir master, it is my great joy to introduce the Choir Department of the Unitech 
Adventist Student Association (Unitech ASA) and share our vision for 2025. Like other 
departments, the choir plays a crucial role in enabling the functioning of the Unitech ASA 
body. We support every department’s program, especially spiritual ones, through the power 
of song."
<br>"This year, we aim to elevate our choir participation, enhance our melodious singing, 
and learn new songs. Our mission is to witness the love of God through singing and, most 
importantly, to revive the cherished spirit of choir. The Choir Department is composed of all 
Unitech ASA members and its sub-associations. However, we warmly welcome any student 
or non-Adventist who wishes to join our team.
Thank you for stopping by."
