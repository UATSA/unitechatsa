                     <p> 
               <p>Greetings to each and every one of you in the precious name of our soon-coming Savior, Jesus 
Christ. It is with great joy and anticipation that we welcome you to the Spiritual Department of the 
Unitech Adventist Tertiary Students Association (ATSA). This department exists to serve the spiritual 
needs of all Adventist students at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology (Unitech), and it is 
our mission to create a nurturing, supportive environment where your relationship with God can 
flourish during your time at the university.<br>
The heart of the Spiritual Department is dedicated to fostering your spiritual growth, ensuring that 
your relationship with God remains strong and vibrant as you navigate the challenges and 
opportunities of university life. We understand the pressures that come with academic pursuits, but 
we are committed to helping you remain grounded in God’s Word, connect deeply with Him, and 
engage in His mission both within the university and the greater community.<br>
The Spiritual Department strives to provide consistent spiritual nourishment through daily Bible 
study, prayer, and various activities that help deepen your connection with God. Our desire is to 
support you in maintaining your spiritual integrity, to inspire you to share your faith with others, and 
to encourage you to actively participate in God’s mission wherever you are.</p>

                        <h3>Bible Study</h3>
                      <p>At the core of our spiritual life is the study of God's Word, and the Spiritual Department encourages 
all Adventist students to regularly engage with the Bible. We emphasize not just the importance of 
studying Scripture but also of internalizing it so that it becomes a guiding light in your life. <br>Through 
organized Bible study sessions, we guide you through personal and group Bible study, encouraging 
reflection on how the Scriptures can be applied to your academic and personal life. By meditating on 
the Word, you will gain wisdom, strength, and clarity, enabling you to live with integrity and 
purpose. <br>
We also encourage students to share the insights they receive through Bible study with 
others, creating an environment where God’s Word is not only studied but lived out in tangible 
ways.

                        <h3>Prayer</h3>
                        <p>Prayer is an essential part of our connection with God, and we believe that a vibrant prayer life is key to spiritual growth. The Spiritual Department organizes group prayer sessions every Sunday morning to give students the opportunity to come together inworship and supplication.<br>
                        These gatherings 
provide a space for sharing personal prayer requests, praying for one another, and building a sense 
of unity in Christ. Through regular prayer, we strengthen our communication with God, bringing our needs, gratitude, and desires before Him. This consistent prayer practice helps us remain connected 
to God, trust in His guidance, and find peace amidst the stresses of university life. 
<br>Moreover, these 
prayer sessions foster a spirit of fellowship among students, enabling them to build relationships 
with others who share similar spiritual goals.

                        <h3>Branch Sabbath School</h3>
                        <p>Every Sabbath morning, the Spiritual Department coordinates a Branch Sabbath School program, 
which is an opportunity for Adventist students to share God’s love with their fellow students, 
especially those living in the dormitories. <br>
This program involves Bible study, sharing personal testimonies, singing, and fellowship. It provides a supportive atmosphere where students can be 
encouraged in their faith and reminded of the joy and hope found in Christ. As students share their 
experiences, they strengthen one another in their spiritual walk, and this program offers a refreshing 
spiritual revival after a busy academic week.<br> 
Through this initiative, students are not only blessed 
but are also empowered to be a blessing to others, helping their peers encounter the love and grace 
of God.

                        <h3>Outreach Program</h3>
                        <p>The Spiritual Department is also deeply committed to engaging in outreach programs that allow 
students to share God’s love with the wider community. <br>
These outreach initiatives are designed to help Adventist students actively participate in spreading the Gospel message while serving those in need. Whether it’s through community service, evangelistic efforts, or other forms of outreach, 
students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their faith through action.<br>
 These programs not only serve to meet the physical and spiritual needs of others but also inspire students to deepen 
their commitment to God’s mission, reinforcing the importance of living out their faith beyond the classroom.

                        <h3>Other Spiritual Programs</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the activities mentioned above, the Spiritual Department also plays a vital role in 
organizing and supporting other spiritual programs within both the church and the broader school 
community. These programs include worship services, spiritual retreats, seminars, and social events 
that encourage students to grow in their relationship with God and with one another. We aim to 
create a dynamic spiritual environment where students can thrive in all aspects of their faith, 
whether it be through personal devotion, communal worship, or active service in the community. 
These programs provide opportunities for spiritual growth, fellowship, and meaningful engagement 
with the Word of God.<br>
As students at Unitech, we are not only here to pursue academic excellence but also to grow 
spiritually and be witnesses for Christ in all that we do. The Spiritual Department is here to support 
us in that journey. We encourage us all to remain connected to God, to stay faithful to His calling, 
and to participate in His mission, both on and off-campus. Together, as a community of believers, we 
can walk with God, experience spiritual growth, and share His love with the world.<br>
May we find strength, peace, and joy as we continue to study and serve, growing in our relationship 
with God every step of the way. Let’s help each other stay steadfast in our commitment to the Lord 
and to His mission as we live out our faith during our time at the university.
